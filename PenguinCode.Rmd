*The following is a template .rmd RMarkdown file for you to use for your homework submission.*

*Please Knit your .rmd to a PDF format or HTML and submit that with no identifiers like your name.*

*To create a PDF, first install tinytex and load the package. Then press the Knit arrow and select "Knit to PDF".*

## QUESTION 01: Data Visualisation for Science Communication

*Create a figure using the Palmer Penguin dataset that is correct but badly communicates the data. **Do not make a boxplot**.*

*Use the following references to guide you:*

-   [*https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a*](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a){.uri}
-   [*https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800){.uri}

*Note: Focus on visual elements rather than writing misleading text on it.*

### a) Provide your figure here:

```{r bad figure code, echo=FALSE}
#Load Raw Data
penguins_raw <- read_csv(here("data", "penguins_raw.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)
#Cleaning the data
penguins_clean <- penguins_raw %>%
  clean_column_names() %>%
  remove_columns(c("comments", "delta")) %>%
  shorten_species() %>%
  remove_empty_columns_rows()

# There is no need to provide the code for your bad figure, just use echo=FALSE so the code is hidden. Make sure your figure is visible after you knit it. 

```

### b) Write about how your design choices mislead the reader about the underlying data (200-300 words).

*Include references.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## QUESTION 2: Data Pipeline

*Write a data analysis pipeline in your .rmd RMarkdown file. You should be aiming to write a clear explanation of the steps, the figures visible, as well as clear code.*

*Your code should include the steps practiced in the lab session:*

-   *Load the data*

-   *Appropriately clean the data*

-   *Create an Exploratory Figure (**not a boxplot**)*

-   *Save the figure*

-   ***New**: Run a statistical test*

-   ***New**: Create a Results Figure*

-   *Save the figure*

*An exploratory figure shows raw data, such as the distribution of the data. A results figure demonstrates the stats method chosen, and includes the results of the stats test.*

*Between your code, communicate clearly what you are doing and why.*

*Your text should include:*

-   *Introduction*

-   *Hypothesis*

-   *Stats Method*

-   *Results*

-   *Discussion*

-   *Conclusion*

*You will be marked on the following:*

### a) Your code for readability and functionality

### b) Your figures for communication

### c) Your text communication of your analysis

*Below is a template you can use.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

```{r Data Exploration}

# Make sure your code prints. 

```

### Hypothesis

### Statistical Methods

```{r Statistics}

# Make sure your code prints. 

```

### Results & Discussion

```{r Plotting Results}

# Make sure your code prints. 

```

### Conclusion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## QUESTION 3: Open Science

### a) GitHub

*Upload your RProject you created for **Question 2** and any files and subfolders used to GitHub. Do not include any identifiers such as your name. Make sure your GitHub repo is public.*

*GitHub link:*

*You will be marked on your repo organisation and readability.*

### b) Share your repo with a partner, download, and try to run their data pipeline.

*Partner's GitHub link:*

*You **must** provide this so I can verify there is no plagiarism between you and your partner.*

### c) Reflect on your experience running their code. (300-500 words)

-   *What elements of your partner's code helped you to understand their data pipeline?*

-   *Did it run? Did you need to fix anything?*

-   *What suggestions would you make for improving their code to make it more understandable or reproducible, and why?*

-   *If you needed to alter your partner's figure using their code, do you think that would be easy or difficult, and why?*

### d) Reflect on your own code based on your experience with your partner's code and their review of yours. (300-500 words)

-   *What improvements did they suggest, and do you agree?*

-   *What did you learn about writing code for other people?*
